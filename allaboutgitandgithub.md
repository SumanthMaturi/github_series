# Q:-Different Aspects Of Git And GitHub
 **Git:-**
**Git** is a __distributed version control system__ allowing us to have control over all the previous versions of our created files as well as allowing easy collaboration to the community tasks.

 **GitHub**
**Github** ;is a hosting service for all our open-source projects,which allows us the full Implementation of git or gitbash.
**Git Workflow**
01. __Workspace__ - Main Directory
02. __Index__ or __Staging Area__
03. __Local Repository__
04. __Remote Repository__

**Different Stages Ig Git project**
01. **Untracked** - File exists but is not pushed to VCS.
02. **Staged** - File has been added to git but hasn't been yet committed.
03. **Committed** - Change has been committed.

**Forking**
If we want to work on some other project or use another project as a starting point for our project or work,then we **fork** it i.e..,we make another copy of that in our githubRepo.
 **Cloning**
After forking, project still remains on **GitHub**. so in order to get it on our PC or Computer or Workspace, we  should **clone** it.

**Branching**
**Branching** is used so that multiple people can combinely do work on a single project without affecting the main project and also can handle different parts of a single project simultaneously by using Branching Technique.

**Pull Request**
It is used whenever we want to merge our changes done with the original project. A heading and a proper description is added for that so that the project supervisor can understand what the changes are made and why it should be incorporated into the project. Once the He/She accepts the **PR** and confirms merge, our files are  ready to merge with the condition of having no merge conflicts.

**Merging** 
Whenever we want to merge two branches we use: **git merge branchname** where, branchname is the branch which gets merged to the branch where we currently are.Usually we merge with master branch which is called as the **Base Branch**.

**Merge Conflict**
A **merge conflict **is an event which occurs when there are conflicting changes occuring on the same lines, so git cannot know which changes to keep and which to discard. So merge conflict demands the problem to be manually solved. The error message directs us to the lines where conflicting code is present.

**Creating An Issue**
If we want to __report__ an issue in an **open-source** project we can do it by raising an issue and this way the issue will be opened in the **open-source** community.
